How long did you spend working on this project?
3 hours more or less
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Getting more comfortable using Ruby classes, private methods, class variables, etc.
What two additional features did you build? Why?
I'm customer driven so I implemented these two features:
- The .purchase method in the Customer class allows a customer to buy two or more products in one line. Why? Because it seem convenient.
- The .show_transactions method in the Customer class allows the customer to retrieve the whole list of transactions associated with him. Why did I implement this? It looks convenient for the customer.
Where do you still have room to grow?
Inheritance. I have not used it in Ruby so far so this is where I have more room to grow.
Also rising and catching errors. I created a couple of errors classes but do not still feel very competent with this topic.
